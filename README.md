# Working with Strava data in Python
This project contains many elements based on learnings applied to my own Strava data. Strava is a fitness website dedicated primarily to cycling, but allowing for a very wide range of activity type tracking (e.g., running, swimming). The premise of my research is to gain statistical insight into my performance based on over 2,000 total activities compiled over several years (starting in 2012). However, you can modify this for your own use without too much difficulty, assuming you've downloaded your Strava data.

I included histograms for at least five key features I've also included some other descriptive characteristics.
